# MSc-Project
In this part, MCS indexing were explored, we tried to save the data in a .csv file wuth each modulation, modulation order and coding rate corresponding to a special MCS but we haven't used a special index for them yet. just saved them with their specifications.
Also, new coding rates for getting more data is also included. these coding rates are 1/2, 2/3 and 3/4.
